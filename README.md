# SEAN (Sophisticated Empowerment Assistant Network)
## A York U Hacks project
### Our Purpose
Developing countries across the world lack the resources ability to meet the needs of their citizens, and their communities. As a result, citizens are unable to access basic necessities that many take for granted: such food, water, education, or healthcare.

The Sophisticated Educational Assistant Network (SEAN) was created with the mission to create global solidarity in making the world a better place. We do this through our service: by pairing citizens of developed countries to citizens of developing countries.

The matching system is not arbitrary. A community representative from a developing country would outline a specific community need, and based on that need they would be paired with someone with the specific skills to help that community to ensure the best results. 

The community need can be anything: from needing to build a school, improve housing infrastructure, or disease prevention and mitigation, the network comprises of hundreds of qualified professionals with diverse professional backgrounds.

Our goal is to raise awareness about the issues that plague these developing countries, and to also show that whether you are an engineer, a chef, or an artist, you, have the potential to better the lives of countless individuals. 

Whether you are an individual seeking to improve your community, or an individual seeking to make your mark on this world, our services will be beneficial for you.
